#import the correct files and registers



#generate coordinate system using MAPPING/node_generator.py



#check the gps coordinates using RFM69/parsedGPS.py



#find closest node information using node finder



#use pathfinder algorithm for proper driver location Dijkstra


#Send drive instructions to arduino



#once final node before passenger is achieved run algorithm for Arduino to drive until passenger is found



#pick up passenger using Lasso commands


#drive to closest node


#dijkstra to find shortest path


#send drive instructions to arudino


#once final node closes to destination is reached. drive and continuous check gps until range value is reached


#drop off passenger using lasso commands


#check RFM for new coordinates.  repeat all
